# Workshop: Building your first React App

<p style='text-align: justify;'>This training workshop will cover the fundamentals of React. React.js is a an open-source JavaScript library for creating user interfaces with a focus on the UI and has become the tool of choice for easily building dynamic user interfaces.</p>

#### Requirements:
* Laptop
* Node/NPM (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* Chrome Extension - React Developer Tools (https://goo.gl/g16a7N)
* Text editor (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started
### 1 - Installing Node

Make sure you have Node 8.10 or later on your local development machine.
```sh 
node -v
```

If you donâ€™t, install the latest version: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/).  


### 2 - Running the Project

Verify that everything works by running:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/feedzai/first-react-app-workshop
cd first-react-app-workshop
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Step by step

### Your First React App 
### 1 - Our first component 
First we need to render a feed of posts so we will need to create the `PhotoFeed` component. To start this will render only a `<div>` with a text inside.

```jsx
// src/components/PhotoFeed.js

  export default class PhotoFeed extends PureComponent {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="App-body">
                PhotoFeed
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

Now we need to display the component in the `PhotoFeedPage`, first import the `PhotoFeed` in the `PhotoFeedPage`.

```js
// src/routes/PhotoFeedPage.js

import PhotoFeed from "../components/PhotoFeed";
```

After importing we need to render the component, in the render method of `PhotoFeedPage` add the previously created component and pass by props the `posts` and the `onLikeIncrement` function.

```js
// src/routes/PhotoFeedPage.js

render() {
    return (
        <PhotoFeed
            posts={this.state.posts}
            onLikeIncrement={this._onLikeIncrement}
        />
    );
}
```

In our `PhotoFeed` component, we need to show all the posts passed throught props. On the render method we need to iterate through a list of Posts. 

Import the `Photo` component and `Col`, `Row` from Ant Design.

```jsx
// src/components/PhotoFeed.js

import Photo from "./Photo";
```

To render multiple items in React, we pass an array of React elements. The most common way to build that array is to map over your array of data. Letâ€™s do that in the render method of PhotoFeed:

```jsx
// src/components/PhotoFeed.js

export default class PhotoFeed extends PureComponent {
    render() {
        const { posts, onLikeIncrement } = this.props;

        return (
            <div className="App-body">
                <Row gutter={40}>
                    {posts.map((post) => (
                        <Col key={`col_${post.id}`} span={8}>
                            <Photo {...post} onLikeIncrement={onLikeIncrement} />
                        </Col>
                    ))}
                </Row>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

### 2 - Update the State something changes

React components can have state by setting `this.state` in the constructor, which should be considered private to the component.
 
In this application the state is stored in the `PhotoDetailsPage` component and then passed to the children components via props.

Whenever `this.setState` is called, an update to the component is scheduled, causing React to merge in the passed state update and re-render the component along with its descendants. 

#### 2.1 - Post Liking

```jsx
// /src/components/Photo.js

{likes}  <Icon  type="heart"  onClick={this._onClickLike}  />
```
On `Photo` component we need to add a callback `_onClickLike` to the existing Icon component. The `_onClickLike` will call `onLikeIncrement` that is passed to Photo component via props by `PhotoDetailsPage` component, this function updates the posts that are stored in state and calls the setState function with the updated posts.

```js
// src/components/Photo.js

_onClickLike = () => {
    this.props.onLikeIncrement(this.props.id);
}
```

Now in the `PhotoFeedPage` we need to save the `posts` state.

```js
// src/routes/PhotoFeedPage.js

_onLikeIncrement = (postId) => {
    const posts = likeIncrement(this.state.posts, postId);

    this.setState({
        posts
    });
};
```

After this the `Photo` component will re-render with the updated number of likes.

### 3 - Add a new Route 

Now we will want to create a new Route to enable us when clicking on a post to go to the details page.

```jsx
// /src/app/App.js

<Route
    path="/:postId"
    component={PhotoDetailsPage}
/>
```
We setup a `Route` in `App` component defining a path, in this case `/:postId`. This path parameter can be accessed by `this.props.match.params.{nameOfTheParameter}` and the component that should be rendered, in this case `PhotoDetailsPage`.


Finally for each `Photo` component we need to add a `Link` that when clicked will change the route of our application to `PhotoDetailsPage` component.

```jsx
// /src/components/Photo.js

<Link to={`/${id}`}>
    <Meta description={caption} />
</Link>
```

### 4 - PropTypes

As your app grows, you can catch a lot of bugs with typechecking. For some applications, you can use JavaScript extensions like Flow or TypeScript to typecheck your whole application. But even if you donâ€™t use those, React has some built-in typechecking abilities. To run typechecking on the props for a component, you can assign the special propTypes property.

Import the `PropTypes`.

```js
// src/components/PhotoFeed.js

import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
```

On the `PhotoFeed` component set the prop `posts` to the type `array` and `required` and the prop `onLikeIncrement` to the type `func` and `required`.

```js
// src/components/PhotoFeed.js

static propTypes = {
    posts: PropTypes.array.isRequired,
    onLikeIncrement: PropTypes.func.isRequired
};
```

## See it run ðŸš€

You're at the end of your journey, and you've accomplished a lot.  **Congrats, You are awesome!**
